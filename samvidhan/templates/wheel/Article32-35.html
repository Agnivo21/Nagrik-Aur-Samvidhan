                    <h2>Article 32: Right to Constitutional Remedies</h2>
                    <p>  Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. It is considered one of the most crucial provisions in the Constitution as it empowers individuals to seek protection and enforcement of their fundamental rights directly from the Supreme Court of India.

                        Article 32 grants every individual the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. This means that if someone believes their fundamental rights have been violated, they can approach the Supreme Court directly for relief. It also ensures that not only do individuals have the right to move the Supreme Court, but the Court also has the power to issue appropriate orders, directions, or writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights.</p>

                    <p> Article 34 of Indian Constitution allows the Parliament to impose restrictions on the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights) during the operation of martial law in any area. It provides indemnity (legal protection) to persons in respect of acts done in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order during martial law. The Parliament may by law validate any acts done under martial law that would otherwise be illegal.Article 34 provides a legal framework for imposing restrictions on fundamental rights during martial law, which is the imposition of direct military control in a situation of extreme emergency.
                        It ensures that any actions taken to restore order and maintain peace during such periods, even if they contravene fundamental rights, are legally protected.

                    <h2>Article 35:Parliament's Power to Legislate on Rights </h2>
                    <p> Article 35 of Indian Constitution safeguards the uniform enforcement of fundamental rights by placing specific matters under the legislative authority of Parliament.
                        It relates to various provisions, including the restriction of fundamental rights for members of the armed forces (Article 33), members of forces maintaining public order, and the indemnity provided under Article 34 during martial law.
                        The Article prevents state legislatures from enacting conflicting laws, thus maintaining consistency in the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights across all states and union territories of India.</p>
