                    <p> Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Freedom of Conscience, allowing individuals to follow their own conscience and practice their religion. It also ensures the Right to Profession, Practice, and Propagation of Religion, meaning people can profess, practice, and share their faith freely. However, this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state in the interests of public order, morality, and health, ensuring that religious practices do not conflict with these broader societal concerns.</p>

                    <p> Article 26 allows every religious denomination or group to establish and maintain its own institutions for religious and charitable purposes. These institutions have the autonomy to manage their own religious affairs, including appointing leaders and overseeing property. However, like other religious freedoms, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state to ensure public order, morality, and health.</p>

                    <p> Article 27 stipulates that individuals cannot be forced to pay taxes that are used specifically for the promotion or maintenance of any religion. This provision ensures the secular nature of the state by preventing public funds from being used to support religious activities, thus maintaining neutrality in religious matters.</p>

                    <h2>Article 28: Freedom from Religious Instruction </h2>
                    <p> Article 28 mandates that government-aided educational institutions must not provide religious instruction, ensuring secularism in state-funded schools. However, religious institutions that do not receive government aid are permitted to offer religious education in their own schools, allowing them to teach their faith while maintaining the separation of state and religion in public education.</p>

        <div class="text"><h2>Case Example : St. Xavier's College v. State of Gujarat (1974).</h2>
            The Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of St. Xavier's College, allowing the institution to include religious instruction in its curriculum despite receiving government aid. The Court held that while government-aided institutions must maintain secularism, religious institutions could still impart religious education as part of their own distinct educational philosophy. The ruling underscored that religious institutions should have the autonomy to impart religious values without state interference, as long as they comply with the constitutional provisions for secularism.This case exemplifies how the articles balances the right to impart religious education with the principle of secularism in government-aided institutions.
